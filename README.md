Our application was inspired from the struggles many of those in our class has to endure with their daily commute. 

We created an application to assist metro riders with their daily commute or wherever it is that they need to go to. Riders will be able to utilize the built in Metro API in our application. After clicking on the specific route that they need to take, they will be routed to the Metro Line view.

###User Accounts & Posts

The application gives the user/rider the opportunity to write posts based upon what is currently going on during the route that they are taking. The user can either login with an existing account or can easily create a new user account in minutes all by using the **Passport** method. They can achieve this by clicking on the **Sign-up** or **Sign-In** button that will route them to the appropriate view. From there, they are able to freely post about anything they desire regarding the current route that they are taking that can help benefit other riders taking that same route. The **post** section will include a space for them to create a short title and then write a small body of content. The application will utilize the *timestamp* method so that the time of their post can be logged for other users to see and stored using **MongoDB**.

***For example***, if the bus they are on has a flat tire, they will be able to create a post such as: 

**Title:** Bus 720 on Wilshire/Highland has a flat tire. **Body:** Need to wait for it to get repaired or wait for the next bus to come by."* *-posted @ 1:23pm on June 17, 2017*

###Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down

There will be a thumbs up button that other users can click on letting users know if they give this post a thumbs up or thumbs down. Every thumbs up will be given a, +1 and a thumbs down a, -1, leaving the post with the appropriate reactions from other users. Very similar to how *Waze* uses the system in their application.


####All of these different features and technologies will be able to make the average daily boring Metro commute, into a more enjoyable social experience.

##Technologies Used:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node JS, MongoDB

###Future Implementation:

* Chat

We would like to eventually incorporate a chatroom in the future where riders are able to chat with each other.
